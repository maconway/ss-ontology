SKOS Notes
Mike Conway


In addition to the standard SKOS apparatus, we have defined several typed literals that contain extra information:

^^sign - indicates the signs that accompany a diagnosis.  For example, "encephalitis" has the signs "limbWeakness" and "hallucination" associated with it.

^^diagnosis - diagnoses associated with symptoms/signs.  For example, the sign "drowsiness" has diagnosis "concussion" and "cerebral bleed"

^^dataCategory can be diagnosis, sign, syndrome OR bioterrorism
