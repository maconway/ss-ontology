# Extended Syndromic Surveillance Ontology (ESSO) #

## An application ontology for syndromic surveillance ##

The Extended Syndromic Surveillance Ontology (ESSO) is an application ontology designed to represent clinical concepts relevant to syndromic surveillance.  It builds on a consensus syndromic surveillance ontology for chief complaints developed at [McGill University](http://www.mcgill.ca/) ([Surveillance Lab](http://surveillance.mcgill.ca/)), the [University of Pittsburgh](http://www.pitt.edu) ([BLULab](http://www.dbmi.pitt.edu/blulab/)) and the [National Institute of Informatics](http://www.nii.ac.jp), Japan ([Collier Group](http://sites.google.com/site/nhcollier/)).  The consensus SSO is constructed around  syndrome definitions generated by representatives from ten operating surveillance systems (see http://surveillance.mcgill.ca/projects/sso/).  The Google code site for the consensus SSO is http://code.google.com/p/syndromic-surveillance-ontology/.

The new ontology (ESSO) -- using the consensus ontology as a basis -- aims to represent new syndromes and relations, while extending our core concepts beyond chief complaints, to include diagnoses and radiology findings.

For further details on syndromic surveillance from chief complaints, the International Society for Disease Surveillance hosts a [wiki](http://isds.wikispaces.com/Syndromic+Surveillance+from+Chief+Complaints) on the subject.
