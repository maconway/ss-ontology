Meeting with John Dowling 29th Jan 2010
Re:  7 syndromes.xls spreadsheet
==========================================================================
I've asked John to:
     1.  Add two new columns:
           - Column 1:  Diagnosis (binary) (e.g. "pulmonary embolism")
           - Column 2:  Syndrome  (binary) (e.g. "cold symptoms")
     2.  Add keywords for those terms not currently covered by the SSO-Junior

Further work (for John):
     1.  Add findings (this depends on exactly how many diagnoses and syndromes there are)
     2.  Add concept/subconcept structure.

Re:  7syndromes.xls spreadheet (i.e. Chief Complaints Ontology Terminology)
==========================================================================

* Each record has a "Primary source" field (field 1).  This refers to the source from which the term was found.  Note that John identified the term first, and only then linked it to a source vocabulary.  Several source vocabs were used:
       1. Biocaster -available
       2. SyndromeCC -ask Wendy
       3. 55 respiratory -ask Wendy
       4  Rods CC -ask Wendy
       5. ICD-9 -available
Blanks indicate that the term identified by John is not in any of the source vocabularies.

* Note that John has included x_ray findings and dx (diagnosis).  It is not obvious how these fit into a chief complaints framework.

* I (MC) have agreed to input the UMLS codes into the spreadsheet.

* There are currently 11 fields in each record, viz:
        1.  (A) Primary source (eg. Biocaster, Rods CC, etc.)
        2.  (B) Primary concept source.  This is a term from the associated primary source (if a code isn't available, then the field is left blank).
        3.  (C) Syndrome (One of the 7 syndromes, GI, etc.)
        4   (D) ConceptName.  Disease concept
        5.  (E) UMLS concept ID:  Probably best in the "DISEASE::XXXX" format"
        6.  (F) Symptom - Patient centred (i.e. subjective reports by the patient).  According to Wikipedia "A symptom is experienced and reported by the patient".
        7.  (G) Sign -  Medic centred (i.e a sign is discovered by the physician in the examination process).
        8.  (H) Related disease
        9.  (I) Analogue disease 
        10. (J) Bioterrorism disease (CDC bioterrorism list in full)
        11. (K) Chest radiograph (disease can only be diagnosed with a chest xray)

* Note that the relationship between Related diseases, analogue diseases and bioterrorism diseases is not straightforward.  It goes something like this:  analogue diseases can be given as the mistaken diagnosis for a bioterrorism disease (i.e. there are sufficient similarities for an early misdiagnosis).  For example, the _analogue_disease_  ASTHMA could be diagnosed instead of the actual _bioterrorism_ disease (e.g. Anthrax, Plague, etc.) [note that the relation is one to many]. The relation between _related_disease_ and _analogue_disease_ follows a similar pattern (with the same one to many relation).  Note however that it is unlikely that a _related_disease_ would be diagnosed in a situation where the *real* illness was a bioterrorism disease.

Things to do (MC):
=================
* Add UMLS codes
* Ensure consistent capitalization of concepts
* Fill in Primary Source Concept if possible
* Add terms for different vocabularies (Mesh, Snomed, ICD-9).  Hopefully we can do this at least semi-automatically.
* Identify any further facts and relations we want to identify.
